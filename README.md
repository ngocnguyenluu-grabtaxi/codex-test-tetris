# Self-Playing Tetris

This repository contains a simple Tetris AI implemented with `pygame`.

Run the game with:

```
python3 self_playing_tetris_pygame.py
```

The AI automatically chooses moves and displays them in a window. Each
tetromino falls row by row with a short pause after it lands so you can watch
the strategy unfold.
