# Self-Playing Tetris

This repository contains a simple console-based Tetris implementation in Python.
The game does not require any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

Run the game with:

```
python3 self_playing_tetris.py
```

The game will automatically choose moves based on a heuristic algorithm and display the board in the terminal until it reaches a game-over state.
