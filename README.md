# Self-Playing Tetris

This repository contains a simple Tetris game implemented with `pygame`.
The game can either be played manually or it can play itself using a
basic AI.

Run the game with:

```
python3 tetris_game.py [--manual]
```

Pass the `--manual` flag if you want to control the pieces yourself. If
the flag is omitted, the AI will play automatically. When playing
manually the side panel will display the keyboard controls.
